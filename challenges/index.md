The goal of challenges is for the research community to define important problems on which multiple solutions should appear. Most challenges already include some system as a baseline and the goal is to produce a better working (e.g. more precise) system. Challenges should be self-contained -- it should take a few hours for a newcomer to implement a naive solution to a challenge.

## Criteria

For a problem to become a challenge, the following is needed:

   * The challenge must define a <b>task</b> and a <b>metric</b> to optimize.
   * The metric to optimize is <b>challenging</b>: the state-of-the-art does not fully solve the problem for all practical purposes and improvements are needed.
   * A <b>training dataset</b> and an <b>evaluation dataset</b> is publicly available. The data should be <b>accessible</b>: using proprietary tools, writing emails or signing-up for services just to obtain the challenge or the data is not acceptable.
   * A work in a research paper tried to solve (a variant of) the problem defined in the challenge.

Ideally a challenge is defined by its description, training and evaluation data. In case reading the data requires some special parser (or a database), this parser should be freely available. If you want to add a challenge, create a pull request <a href="https://github.com/learnbigcode/learnbigcode.github.io/tree/master/challenges">here</a>.
